# python-oneliner

Module for practical Python one-liners.

## Installation

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/seguri/python-oneliner#egg=oneliner

This will install the module, callable with `python -m oneliner`, and an executable provided by pip in the form of `pyl-<sys.version_info.major>.<sys.version_info.minor>`, eg. `pyl-3.4`

## Uninstall

    pip uninstall oneliner

This work is a partial rewrite of [gvalkov/python-oneliner][1] that didn't perform as I expected. I t was also an opportunity to better learn Python's `import` system.
